##Project summary

Here I present projects undertaken during the learning course.

Ardent survival Titanic - This is a project used to apply machine learning algorithms to analyze the data in the titanic.csv file. The titanic.csv contains all the information about the people who were involved in the sinking of the RMS Titanic. Project uses logistic regression, machine learning algorithms to predict the survival.

Big cities Health survey - The project analyzes health status, death rates, and other socio-economic and demographic factors that affect the health of communities. Uses Pandas, matplotlib to plot data and draw inferences.

Explore Beverages usage - The project's objective is to study country wise consumption of Beverages using numpy and matplotlib.

Explore nutritional information - This is healthcare project digging into nutritional data and its impact using pandas

Explore unemployment rates in US - using Time series dataset and matplotlib

Explore US Birth Rates - Read a csv file based on time series data set and process data.

First Project - This is web project for Python and Django, implementing basic flow of MVC model

Gender Gap in college degrees - Using visualizations by Python pandas package, we'll explore how we can communicate the nuanced narrative of gender gap using effective data visualization

Study NY public school - The project explores NYC schools and their class, demographic, results for SAT score Year wise. Later this studies correlation and plots using matplotlib.

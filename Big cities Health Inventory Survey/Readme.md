# Big Cities Health Inventory Platform

the Big Cities Health Inventory (BCHI) data platform has more than 50 indicators that look at health status, death rates, and other socio-economic and demographic factors that affect the health of a community.

The indicators encompass nine broad categories of public health importance: Behavioral Health and Substance Abuse; Cancer; Chronic Disease; Environmental Health; Food Safety; HIV/AIDs; Infectious Disease; Injury and Violence; and Maternal and Child Health. Two additional categories include demographics and life expectancy/overall death rate. These indicators were chosen based on their relationship to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States and their role in creating healthier, safer communities

DATA SOURCES
Much of these data come directly from cities, while some were also secured from the U.S. Census or other similar publicly available data set for which city data were available.

RACE AND ETHNICITY
Where sample sizes allow, indicators are broken down into subpopulations for race and ethnicity categories. For most jurisdictions, the default options were White (Non-Hispanic), Black (Non-Hispanic), Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Other. 

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE
The percentage of adults who binge drank is based (in most cases) on the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System

(BRFSS) question about how many drinks a person had on one occasion in the past 30 days. Women who answered “four” and men who answered “five” are considered binge drinkers.

Similarly, percent of high school students who binge drank is based (in most cases) on the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBS/YRBSS) question regarding five or more drinks within a couple hours on one or more occasions in the past 30 days.

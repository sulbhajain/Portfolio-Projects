## Project summary

Here I present few of the many projects undertaken during my endeavour to hone and thrive on my Data Science skills. These projects showcase my experiences of below packages, algorithms with interesting insights usable for taking key business decisions. The projects are updated regularly as and when new concepts are learned and implemented. So this repository always remains "work in progress " :)

Some hand picked projects are:

Hand gesture prediction, 2018
Classification modeling to predict hand written digits based on black and white images of size 28 x 28 pixels. Imported vector formatted data stored as 2-dimensional matrix. Defined network parameters and developed multi-layer perceptron model with RELU activation, weights and biases. Minimized the cost (loss) using AdamOptimizer. Achieved 94% accuracy in the predictions. 

Bank Note Authentication, 2018 
Analyzed digitized data taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens presented in form of variance, skewness, curtosis and entropy of images. Prepared data for neural network and deep learning systems by standardizing. Trained the model using Contriblearn from TensorFlow and classified with deep neural network. Evaluated Model performance with 100% F1-score and precision. Compared with Random forest classifier, DNN was found better with higher accuracy as per classification report and confusion matrix. 

Topic Modelling and content Analyzing to classify Yelp reviews, 2018 
Classified Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based on the text content in the reviews. Pre-processed text by removing stop words, punctuation. Normalized using stemming. Used bag-of-words approach to convert text corpus to vector format, vectorized using TF-IDF. Trained the classification model using Naive Bayes classifier algorithm. Predicted and evaluated using classification report. Created scikit learn’s pipeline workflow to define all the transformations. Achieved 93% precision without TF-IDF text processing.  

Movie recommendation using Recommender System, 2018
Build basic recommender system on MovieLens dataset using correlation, pandas, Pivot table, python by suggesting movies that are most similar to a particular movies

Principal components Analyses on high dimensional data, 2018
Implemented scikit learn’s PCA for dimensionality reduction. Preprocessed the breast cancer data in order to find the first two principal components. Scaled and transformed data so that each feature has a single unit variance. Visualized the new data in two-dimensional space, with a single scatter-plot.

Regression modeling for used car price Prediction, 2017
Processed and cleaned web-scraped dataset for missing values and duplicates. Removed outlier values and applied feature engineering, scaling and normalization. Analyzed the market prices for used cars and predicted my car value with only 3.4% error (RMSE, Ridge, Lasso, Cross-validation, Python)

Time Series Analysis for Health Trend Data, 2017
Imported data from google trends for ‘diet’, ‘gym’ and ‘finance’ keywords to see how they vary over time. Identified Trend with rolling mean and removed with first order differencing. Analyzed Seasonality in the data with correlation. I figured that initially what appeared as negative correlation between Diet and Gym, after removing trend it became positive correlation. Plotted Autocorrelation of ‘Diet’ series with lag of 12 months. Studied data distribution using lagplot, bootstrap plot.

Ardent survival Titanic - This is a project used to apply machine learning algorithms to analyze the data in the titanic.csv file. The titanic.csv contains all the information about the people who were involved in the sinking of the RMS Titanic. Project uses logistic regression, machine learning algorithms to predict the survival.

Big cities Health survey - The project analyzes health status, death rates, and other socio-economic and demographic factors that affect the health of communities. Uses Pandas, matplotlib to plot data and draw inferences.

Explore Beverages usage - The project's objective is to study country wise consumption of Beverages using numpy and matplotlib.

Explore nutritional information - This is healthcare project digging into nutritional data and its impact using pandas

Explore unemployment rates in US - using Time series dataset and matplotlib

Explore US Birth Rates - Read a csv file based on time series data set and process data.

First Project - This is web project for Python and Django, implementing basic flow of MVC model

Gender Gap in college degrees - Using visualizations by Python pandas package, we'll explore how we can communicate the nuanced narrative of gender gap using effective data visualization

Study NY public school - The project explores NYC schools and their class, demographic, results for SAT score Year wise. Later this studies correlation and plots using matplotlib.

## Summary

Here I present few of the many projects undertaken during my endeavour to hone and thrive on my Data Science skills. These projects stand as my experience through learning and implemention on real world data. 

The projects are updated regularly as and when new concepts are learned and implemented. So this repository always remains "work in progress " :)

### Python Projects
Python is key programming language used in data analysis. The repo showcases some of the finest projects with webscrapping, image processing, web development etc. 

### Machine Learning
Implementation of ML Algorithms in python with interesting insights usable for taking key business decisions. 

### Deep Learning
Apply deep learning to complex data and acquire prediction using neural networks.
 
### Data Exploration and Visualization
There is no data science without getting the feel of data. The projects in python walk thru importing data, plotting relationships and building the understanding of the features of data.

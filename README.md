## Summary

Here I present few of the many projects undertaken during my endeavour to hone and thrive on my Data Science skills. These projects stand as my experience through learning and implemention on real world data. 

The projects are updated regularly as and when new concepts are learned and implemented. So this repository always remains "work in progress " :)

### Python Projects
Python is key programming language used in data analysis. The repo showcases some of the finest projects with webscrapping, image processing, web development etc. 

### Machine Learning
Implementation of ML Algorithms in python with interesting insights usable for taking key business decisions. 

### Deep Learning
Apply deep learning to complex data and acquire prediction using neural networks.
 
### Data Exploration and Visualization
There is no data science without getting the feel of data. The projects in python walk thru importing data, plotting relationships and building the understanding of the features of data.

### Data Science Experience                                                                                                2015-Present

Hand gesture prediction, 2018
Classification modeling to predict hand written digits based on black and white images of size 28 x 28 pixels. Imported vector formatted data stored as 2-dimensional matrix. Defined network parameters and developed multi-layer perceptron model with RELU activation, weights and biases. Minimized the cost (loss) using AdamOptimizer. Achieved 94% accuracy in the predictions. 

Bank Note Authentication, 2018 
Analyzed digitized data taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens presented in form of variance, skewness, curtosis and entropy of images. Prepared data for neural network and deep learning systems by standardizing. Trained the model using Contriblearn from TensorFlow and classified with deep neural network. Evaluated Model performance with 100% F1-score and precision. Compared with Random forest classifier, DNN was found better with higher accuracy as per classification report and confusion matrix. 

Topic Modelling and content Analyzing to classify Yelp reviews, 2018 
Classified Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based on the text content in the reviews. Pre-processed text by removing stop words, punctuation. Normalized using stemming. Used bag-of-words approach to convert text corpus to vector format, vectorized using TF-IDF. Trained the classification model using Naive Bayes classifier algorithm. Predicted and evaluated using classification report. Created scikit learn’s pipeline workflow to define all the transformations. Achieved 93% precision without TF-IDF text processing.  

Movie recommendation using Recommender System, 2018
Build basic recommender system on MovieLens dataset using correlation, pandas, Pivot table, python by suggesting movies that are most similar to a particular movies

Principal components Analyses on high dimensional data, 2018
Implemented scikit learn’s PCA for dimensionality reduction. Preprocessed the breast cancer data in order to find the first two principal components. Scaled and transformed data so that each feature has a single unit variance. Visualized the new data in two-dimensional space, with a single scatter-plot.

Regression modeling for used car price Prediction, 2017
Processed and cleaned web-scraped dataset for missing values and duplicates. Removed outlier values and applied feature engineering, scaling and normalization. Analyzed the market prices for used cars and predicted my car value with only 3.4% error (RMSE, Ridge, Lasso, Cross-validation, Python)

Time Series Analysis for Health Trend Data, 2017
Imported data from google trends for ‘diet’, ‘gym’ and ‘finance’ keywords to see how they vary over time. Identified Trend with rolling mean and removed with first order differencing. Analyzed Seasonality in the data with correlation. I figured that initially what appeared as negative correlation between Diet and Gym, after removing trend it became positive correlation. Plotted Autocorrelation of ‘Diet’ series with lag of 12 months. Studied data distribution using lagplot, bootstrap plot.

MS Azure Implementation for Early Detection of diabetes, 2016
Published web service for prediction of Diabetes on a clinical dataset. Normalized clinical dimensions with ZScore and age with minmax. Cleaned data, trained model with Two class Boosted Decision Tree. Achieved good prediction with 99% AUC. Web service used for MS-Excel plugins.
